1. We make a HTTP request to a website: example-> amazon.com

2. We get back a response from the web server that amazon.com is associated with

3. The response is a web page (front-end)

4. A web page consists of: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

5. HTML = Content of the page (Bold Text, regular text, buttons, form inputs, images, hyperlinks)

6. CSS = Styling of the content (layout, colors, making some content next to other content)

7. JS = Interactivity (clicking, hovering, scrolling, typing) between the user and web page which results in modification of the HTML and CSS
